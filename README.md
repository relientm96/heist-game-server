## Design

heist-game-server is a Node.js HTTP server built in line with our [technology strategy].
It uses the [Express] middleware framework and common SEEK packages.
Resource APIs enable synchronous interactions and serve as the backbone of SEEK's general service architecture.

This project is deployed as a containerised application with [Gantry].
A typical resource API instance does not require more than 1 vCPU,
so we eschew clustering configurations in favour of a single Node.js process per container.
Under load, we autoscale horizontally in terms of container count up to `autoScaling.maxCount`.
